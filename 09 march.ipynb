    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of each possible outcome or value of the random variable. The PMF assigns a probability to each value in the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF would be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(x) = 1/6 for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",
    "PMF(x) = 0 for any other value of x\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to specific values, the PDF assigns probabilities to intervals or ranges of values. The area under the PDF curve within a given interval represents the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "consider the standard normal distribution, which has a bell-shaped curve. The PDF of the standard normal distribution is a symmetric curve centered at the mean of zero. It describes the relative likelihood of different values occurring."

    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-->  The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a statistical function that provides the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the CDF. Consider a fair six-sided die. The CDF of this die would give the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to a given value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF would be:\n",
    "CDF(x <= 1) = 1/6\n",

    "CDF(x <= 5) = 5/6\n",
    "CDF(x <= 6) = 6/6 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the CDF, we can answer questions like \"What is the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 4?\" The CDF tells us that the probability is 4/6 or 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is useful in various statistical applications, including hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and determining percentiles of a distribution. It provides a comprehensive view of the distribution and allows for calculations of probabilities and quantiles"

    "1. Heights of adult humans: The distribution of heights in a population tends to follow a roughly normal distribution, with most people clustering around the average height.\n",

    "The shape of the normal distribution is determined by its parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center or average of the distribution, and it determines the location of the peak or highest point on the curve. The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean, resulting in a narrower and taller distribution. Conversely, a larger standard deviation indicates a wider and flatter distribution, with data points more spread out from the mean.\n"

The Bernoulli distribution is characterized by a single parameter, p, which represents the probability of success.\n",

    "Example: Consider flipping a fair coin, where getting a head is considered a success and getting a tail is considered a failure. The outcome of this experiment can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution, where p = 0.5 represents the probability of success (getting a head) and q = 1 - p = 0.5 represents the probability of failure (getting a tail).\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) makes several assumptions in order to hold true:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Observations: The observations in the sample should be independent of each other and should be drawn from the same population or distribution. This assumption ensures that the observations do not influence each other and are representative of the overall population.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 Finite Mean and Variance: The population from which the sample is drawn should have a finite mean (μ) and a finite variance (σ^2). This assumption ensures that the population distribution is well-defined and not excessively skewed or heavy-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3 Sample Size: The CLT assumes that the sample size is sufficiently large. While there is no strict cutoff for the sample size, a general guideline is that the sample size should be greater than or equal to 30. Larger sample sizes generally result in better approximations to a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4 No Extreme Outliers: The CLT assumes that there are no extreme outliers in the sample. Outliers can significantly affect the sample mean and can distort the normality assumption.\n",
