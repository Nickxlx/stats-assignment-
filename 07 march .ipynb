    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency used to describe the typical or central value of a dataset. Here's an explanation of each measure and the differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "The mean is the average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers because it takes into account every data point in the calculation. It is commonly used when the data is normally distributed or symmetrically distributed around a central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers and extreme values compared to the mean. It is often used when the data contains outliers or when the distribution is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value or values that appear most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it is the value(s) with the highest frequency. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data. The mode is useful for identifying the most common or dominant value in a dataset.\n"

    "\n",
    "Answer--> Here's an explanation of each measure and how they are used :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides an idea of the total spread of the data. However, it only considers two extreme values and may not capture the entire variability of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance is a more comprehensive measure of dispersion that takes into account the differences between each data point and the mean. It is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Variance gives us an understanding of how much the individual data points deviate from the mean on average. A higher variance indicates greater dispersion or variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average amount of dispersion or variability of the data points from the mean. Standard deviation provides a more intuitive understanding of the spread because it is in the same unit as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",

    "Answer--> Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect the mean or average of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mean is sensitive to extreme values, even a single outlier can greatly pull the mean away from the center of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the median is more robust to outliers because it is resistant to extreme values. The median represents the middle value in a sorted dataset, so outliers have less influence on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can have a substantial impact on measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, can be distorted by outliers that are much larger or smaller than the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly increase the variance and standard deviation since these measures quantify the spread of the data from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the dataset has a large number of observations and the outliers are not extreme, the impact on variance and standard deviation may be less pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class: [85, 92, 88, 95, 90, 72, 98, 83, 82, 200]. In this dataset, the value 200 is an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The outlier value 200 significantly affects the mean, pulling it towards the higher end.\n",
    "Median: The median is not affected by the outlier, as it remains the same (90) regardless of the outlier.\n",
    "Mode: The mode is not affected by the outlier, as it remains the same (no mode in this dataset) regardless of the outlier.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The outlier increases the range from 200 - 72 = 128 to 200 - 72 = 128, expanding the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: The outlier increases the variability of the data, resulting in larger values for variance and standard deviation compared to a dataset without the outlier."
