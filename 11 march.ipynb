    "Suppose you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of students, one from School A and the other from School B. You collect samples of heights from both groups, and the sample sizes are relatively small (e.g., 25 students from each school).

    "Here's how we can calculate each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D|A) = 0.05 (5% of Type A components are defective)\n",

    "P(B) = 0.90 (90% of the components produced are Type B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "        ≈ 0.217\n",

    "Answer--> we can use the formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "Given: Sample Size (n) = 500 Sample Proportion (p) = 0.65 (65%)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE), which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of proportions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SE = √[(p * (1 - p)) / n]\n",

    "Interpretation: We can be 95% confident that the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job falls within the range of approximately 60.82% to 69.18%.
